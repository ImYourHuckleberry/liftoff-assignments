I am aiming to make a workout app for the intermediate lifting program [Jacked and Tan 2.0](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html). Currently there are no good web apps to quickly calculate and present the weights and repititions for the program. Currently most programs will allow you to put in weights, reps, and sets. What they lack is the ability to update at a constant rate. For exemple, in Jacked and Tan your first week you lift your first weight for three sets of five reps at 95% of your one rep max for that lift. Your second lift of the day is based on a perentage of a training max. The percentages and the reps of the various exercises change throughtout the week. With the currently available ways to available in the gym room it is a pain to track past workouts and calculate/remember weights based on a percentage of a one rep max, especially when youre trying to stay focused on lifting big heavy weights.

I am proposing a program that keeps track of the changes for you. As a user you would enter your one rep max for various exercises and the program would spit out your ideal workout for the next day. Jacked and Tan 2.0 is a twelve week program, so the app would take you through twelve weeks. If implemented correctly the app would take the math, and a lot of the difficulty, out of an effective but hard to grasp intermediate program. I know there is a need for something like this because I struggle with it personally in the gym and in my training as a whole.
